DIFFICULTIES: I had a hard time figuring out how to exactly implement all of the methods, yet with some trial and error, I figured it out. 

LEARNING MOMENTS: The lesson really helped me understand how to use methods with one another, and it also helped me get better at implementing methods in general. The practice  that the lesson provided me was invaluable. 
WHAT I ENJOYED: It was fun trying out new things, debugging the program, and seeing what I could do with methods.
